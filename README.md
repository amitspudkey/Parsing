# BN_Parsing
This program takes a csv given csv, parses, and encodes a given column of the data from a given deliminator. 

It operates very similar to a one-hot encoder, except it doesn't remove the last encoded type.

It's primary use is to encode every word within a string or to break up a string based on a delimiter.

    The processing time varies exponentially with the number of encoding categories and rows.
